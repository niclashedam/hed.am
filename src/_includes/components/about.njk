              I have more than 13 years of technical experience focused on infrastructure, security and privacy. I hold

              I work at the point where technical depth meets business reality, pinpointing where security will actually
              reduce risk without disrupting critical operations. I challenge weak assumptions, quantify impact, and
              prioritise what moves the needle.

              Outside academia, I have collaborated with companies across industries and founded my first business at
              16, gaining insight into real-world constraints and the importance of aligning security with business
              value.

              My goal is to help build a secure digital society where data and privacy are protected while supporting
              innovation and meeting regulatory demands.
